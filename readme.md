CPU Affinity!
Performance Optimization: Restricting a thread to specific CPUs can reduce the overhead of context switching between different CPUs. This is particularly useful in real-time systems or performance-critical applications.

Cache Utilization: When a thread runs on a specific CPU, it can benefit from the CPU’s cache, as the cache contents are more relevant to the thread’s data and instructions. This can lead to improved performance due to reduced cache misses.

Load Balancing: In some cases, you might want to manually balance the load across cores, or ensure that certain threads don’t interfere with others running on different cores.

Real-Time Requirements: For real-time applications, maintaining CPU affinity can help meet strict timing requirements by ensuring that a thread consistently runs on a CPU with known characteristics and load.


Setting CPU Affinity:
In Linux: Use functions like pthread_setaffinity_np() for threads or sched_setaffinity() for processes.
